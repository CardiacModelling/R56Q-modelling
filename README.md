# Modelling of the R56Q hERG channel mutation
This repository contains scripts for optimising a model of the hERG ion channel to wild type (WT) and R56Q mutant channel electrophysiology data. The work forms the basis of the modelling results found in:

"The hERG channel activator, RPR260243, reduces arrhythmogenicity of the R56Q LQTS mutation by enhancing repolarizing drive in the refractory period" by Jacob M. Kemp, Dominic G. Whittaker, Ravichandra Venkateshappa, ZhaoKai Pang, Raj Johal, Valentine Sergeev, Glen F. Tibbits, Gary R. Mirams, and Tom Claydon (currently under review).

## Installation

It is recommended to install libraries and run scripts in a virtual environment to avoid version conflicts between different projects. In order to do this, follow these steps:
- `virtualenv venv` or if you have both python 2 and 3: `virtualenv --python=python3 venv`. If `virtualenv` is not recognised you may need to call it as `python -m virtualenv venv` or (`python -m virtualenv venv`). If that doesn't work you may need to install virtualenv first `pip install virtualenv`.
- Activate the virtual environment using `source venv/bin/activate`. Simply type `deactivate` to exit the virtual environment at the end of a session.
- Install the required packages by typing `pip install -r requirements.txt`
